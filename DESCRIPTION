Description: This package provides a data snapshot of two numeric variables. 
    It contains a function, data_snapshot(), which returns summary statistics for the numeric variables (max, min, mean, median), 
    as well as a scatterplot and the adjusted R squared value (as a percentage) to provide a sense of the linear relationship between 
    two numeric variables from a given dataset.
