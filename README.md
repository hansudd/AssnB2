# B2package

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Overview

This package was created for Assignment B2 as part of STAT545B in the
fall of 2021.

The goal of B2package is to provide a package that contains a function
that helps provide a snapshot of oneâ€™s data. Specifically, this package
provides a data snapshot of two numeric variables. It contains a
function which returns summary statistics for the numeric variables, as
well as a scatterplot and the adjusted R squared value to provide a
sense of the linear relationship between the variables (if any).
Generally, the adjusted r squared value, a value between 0 and 1
(displayed as a percentage), represents the proportion of variance
observed for a dependent variable explained by the independent variable
in a linear regression model.

## Installation

B2package is not yet on CRAN. But, you can download it from this
repository using the following R command:

``` r
devtools::install_github("hansudd/AssnB2")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hansudd/AssnB2", ref = "0.1.0")
```

## Examples

**Example 1:** This is an example that shows you how to quickly
visualize and assess the relationship between two numeric variables:

``` r
# loading the B2package package
library(B2package)

## example 1 of the data_snapshot function 
data_snapshot(mtcars, hp, mpg)
#> [[1]]
#>   max min     mean median
#> 1 335  52 146.6875    123
#> 
#> [[2]]
#>    max  min     mean median
#> 1 33.9 10.4 20.09062   19.2
#> 
#> [[3]]
```

    #> 
    #> [[4]]
    #> [1] "Adjusted R-square is 58.92 %"

Example 1 shows the linear relationship between two numeric variables
from the `mtcars` dataset, hp vs mpg. We observe an adjusted r-squared
value of 58.92 %. Example 2 will feature an example where there is a
stronger linear relationship between the two variables.

**Example 2:** This is another example that shows you how to quickly
visualize and assess the relationship between two numeric variables:

``` r
# example 2 of the data_snapshot function
data_snapshot(mtcars, mpg, wt)
#> [[1]]
#>    max  min     mean median
#> 1 33.9 10.4 20.09062   19.2
#> 
#> [[2]]
#>     max   min    mean median
#> 1 5.424 1.513 3.21725  3.325
#> 
#> [[3]]
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="100%" />

    #> 
    #> [[4]]
    #> [1] "Adjusted R-square is 74.46 %"

Example 2 shows the linear relationship between the variables mpg and wt
from the `mtcars` dataset. Here, we report a higher adjusted r-squared
value of 74.46 %.

Hence, from these two usage examples, we see that the `data_snapshot`
function returns a scatterplot and the adjusted r squared value when fed
two numeric variables.

This package is helpful if you frequently work on datasets with two
numeric variables, and you want to quickly determine if there is a
linear relationship between the variables.
